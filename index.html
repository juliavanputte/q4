			<p>Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane cultural objects. One of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.Among the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Robert Rauschenberg.</p>

			<p>A travel agency is a private retailer or public service that provides travel and tourism related services to the public on behalf of suppliers such as activities, airlines, car rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, and package tours. In addition to dealing with ordinary tourists, most travel agencies have a separate department devoted to making travel arrangements for business travelers; some travel agencies specialize in commercial and business travel only. </p>

			<p>Art is a creative activity that expresses imaginative or technical skill. It produces an artifact, also called a work of art, for others to experience. Those who do this are called artists. They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it. Some people find art relaxing, or exciting, or informative. Many people disagree on how to define art. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity. Art includes drawing, painting, sculpting, photography, performance art, dance, music, poetry, prose and theatre. Art is divided into the plastic arts, where something is made, and the performing arts, where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.</p>

			<p>When I was young, we had a golden retriever named Sam. I loved him so much, but I don't really remember him. He died when in 2011. For that entire year, I begged my parents to let me get another dog. Being an only child, I desperately wanted someone to play with at home. Usually I got many presents for Christmas, but that year, I told my dad that the only thing I wanted was a little puppy. I wanted a female Golden Retriever. My parents broke down and got me a puppy, Charlotte, or Chari for short. She is so beautiful, playful, loyal, and fun. Charlotte is always happy to see me when I walk in the door, and she keeps me company when I am sad. I am so happy to have a dog like Chari.</p>
